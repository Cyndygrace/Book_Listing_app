first make sure u have node installed on ur computer
create a root folder on your desktop or any directory
then open on vscode
create a new folder inside ur root folder called server
cd in to the server folder
initialise npm on the terminal
npm init -y
This will generate our package.json file that will store all our dependencies we install.

next we install our express app
npm install express --save
This will automatically generate our package-lock.json and node-modules that will contain the express module.
This will also store express module as a dependency in our package.json file.
